    "\n",
    "The fundamental element of quantum computing is the *quantum circuit*. A circuit will act on a predefined amount of quantum data (qubits) with unitary operations (gates), measurements and resets. In addition, a quantum circuit can contain operations on classical data, incluiding real-time computations and control-flow constructs, which are executed by the controllers of the QPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits are at a low level of abstraction when building up quantum programs. They are the construct that is used to build up to higher levels of abstraction, such as the primitives of quantum computation, which accumulate data from many shots of quantum-curcuits execution, along with advanced error-mitigation techniques and measurement optimizations, into a well-typed classical data and error statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qiskit, circuits can be defined in one of two regimes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an abstract circuit.\n",
    "- a physical circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert from an abstract circuit to a physical circuit by using Qiskit's transpilation package, of which the top-level access point is `transpile()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qiskit, a quantum circuit is represented by the QuantumCircuit class. Bellow is an example of a quantum circuit that makes a three-qbuit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state defined as:\n",
